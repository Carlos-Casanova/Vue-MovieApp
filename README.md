# Vue Movie Project - Frontend Technical Interview

This project was developed as part of a technical interview for a Frontend Developer position at a real estate company in Mexico City (They decided not to move forward with my application and I didn't get the job, by the way). The application aims to simulate a movie streaming service and fetches data from a movie API (themoviedb.org) to display information about available movies.

## Description

It is a simple web application that allows users to explore and view information about movies of various genres. It uses an API (themoviedb) to obtain real-time data about movies, such as title, release year, genre, and synopsis. It also features a filter in the main menu to refine the selection of movies by genre, rating, etc.

## Features

- Displays a list of popular movies.
- Allows users to view details of a specific movie.
- Movie filtering
- Attractive and user-friendly user interface.
